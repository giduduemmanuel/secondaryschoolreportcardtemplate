Competence-Based Curriculum Report Card System - README

Overview

This Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) Report Card System is designed for Ugandan secondary schools following the national competence-based education framework. The system generates detailed report cards that evaluate students based on their competency achievement levels across subjects, moving beyond traditional grading to focus on skill mastery and real-world application.

Key Features

- Competence-Based Assessment: Evaluates students against competency benchmarks rather than pure numerical scores
- Comprehensive Subject Tracking: Monitors performance across all curriculum subjects
- Multi-dimensional Scoring: Incorporates continuous assessment, termly scores, and Activity of Integration (AoI) evaluations
- Automated Grade Calculation: Converts scores to competency levels with descriptors
- Professional Report Generation: Produces print-ready report cards with teacher comments
- Achievement Identifiers: Provides clear indicators of competency mastery levels

System Requirements
- Microsoft Excel 2010 or later (full functionality)
- Printer for generating physical report cards
- Basic understanding of Uganda's competence-based curriculum

Data Structure
Assessment Components:
1. Continuous Assessment (C1-C4): Progressive chapter assessments
